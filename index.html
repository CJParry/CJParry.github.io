						<h2><a>NFT Random Generator<br /></h2>
					</header>
					<a class="image fit"><img src="images/nftGenerator.jfif" alt="" /></a>
					<p>To build on my NFT and blockchain skills, I created a line of randomly generated NFTs, lazy
						minted from a React front-end. The NFT metadata is generated dynamically and stored in a locally
						run IPFS node. To allow for true random NFT generation, I used the Ethers.js library to sign
						the customers transaction with the NFT contract owners private key at runtime.</p>

						<h2><a>Arbitrage Trading Bot<br /></h2>
					</header>
					<a class="image fit"><img src="images/arbitrageBot.PNG" alt="" /></a>
					<p>Written in Solidity and Web3, this bot listens for swap events on
						various decentralized exchanges, such as UniSwap and PancakeSwap. When the price spread between
						two pools presents an arbitrage opportunity, it utilises a flash loan to borrow the cheaper
						asset and sell it in the more expensive trading pool. It was developed on the Rinkeby and Fantom
						testnets, then deployed on the Fantom mainnet.</p>

						<h2><a>Auto Leverage Farming Bot<br /></h2>
					</header>
					<a class="image fit"><img src="images/tarotStats.PNG" alt="" /></a>
					<p>In Defi, it is possible to use your liquidity provider tokens as collatoral to leverage against,
						to earn a higher yield. However, this risks liquidation. To safeguard against this, I created a
						bot in Web3 that monitors the current liquidation level of my leveraged position, and
						automatically deleverages when liquidation is close. This bot interacts with the Tarot protocol
						Solidity contracts on the Fantom blockchain.</p>

					<p>This website allows users to connect their MetaMask wallet through Web3 to mint their own
						personal ERC20 or BEP20 tokens, with custom inputs for token name, symbol and max supply.</p>

					<a class="image fit"><video controls muted width="400">
							<source src="videos/UnityPVRDemoNoSound.mp4" type="video/mp4"></a>
					<p>As the lead engineer I was responsible for building a Virtual Reality decision making training
						simulator in Unity, based off the previous UE4 prototype. I designed and developed most aspects
						of the system. These included the level design, AI, record and replay system, data analytics and
						speech recognition.</p>

					</header>
					<a class="image fit"><video controls muted width="400">
							<source src="videos/UE4PVRDemoNoSound.mp4" type="video/mp4"></a>
					<p>This VR decision making training simulator was developed in UE4. It was built as a
						proof-of-concept to lead into a full project. I developed the AI, audio, scene recording,
						playback functionality and networking capabilities. Most of the system is built using UE4
						blueprints.</p>

					</a>
					<p>VOARLA (Voice Operated Augmented Reality Logistics Application) is a hands-free pathfinding
						system, designed to guide the user to the goal. I was the sole designer and developer. Built in
						Unity for the Magic Leap One, the prototype was used to complete research into voice interaction
						with natural language understanding in AR. It utilizes IBM Watson Cloud speech services.</p>

							allow="autoplay; fullscreen; gyroscope; accelerometer" allowfullscreen></iframe>
					</a>

					<p>Built in Unity, this project required updating an existing virtual reality 360-film experience.
						Working closely with the client, I updated the video, added 3D audio and made several tweaks to
						the intro.</p>

							</a></h2>
					</header>
					<a class="image fit"><img src="images/ARInductiondemo3.jpg" alt="" /></a>
					<p>Aimed at reducing the need for supervised workplace inductions, I was the sole developer building
						the prototype. Built in Unity, the induction instructions were superimposed over the real-world
						physical drill press. It featured training videos and text instructions, activated by the AR
						wearers proximity to the drill press. Created in four days, the prototype was later demonstrated
						at Air NZ.</p>

						<h2><a>Te Papa Touchscreen Bird Game<br />
							</a></h2>
					</header>
					<a class="image fit"><img src="images/birdGame.jpg" alt="" /></a>
					<p>With a target audience of five to twelve year olds, this game is currently on display at the
						Museum of New Zealand, Te Papa Tongarewa. The theme is native New Zealand and involves matching
						the correct bird to tree, to help grow a forest. I was the team leader, contributing to the
						management, design and development of the project.</p>
